# casaos-docker-service

HaLOS includes CasaOS as a core component for managing Docker containers through a user-friendly web interface. As opposed to the standard CasaOS installation, CasaOS is run in a Docker container itself, allowing for easier updates and isolation from the host system. This repository contains the Docker service configuration and compose files needed to deploy CasaOS on HaLOS as well as Debian packaging to facilitate installation and management of the service.
